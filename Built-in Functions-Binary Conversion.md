# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
Write a python program to convert 76 to binary number using built in functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `17` to a variable `x`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

x=76
print(bin(x))

## Output
